      uterra:
        desc: Uterra is a nature based faction. Based on swarm, poisons and breakthrough, good for overwhelming opponents.
        official_0: While the surface of the world is covered by inhospitable sheets of ice, there is life underground. The Uterra make their home in vast caverns deep beneath the tundra above.
        official_1: This subterranean network is unlike anything found on the surface, teeming as it is with life. The walls of the caves mysteriously radiate with light and heat, allowing vegetation and animal life impossible elsewhere to not only exist, but to thrive.
        official_2: The Uterrans harness the magic of nature â€“ of life and growth, and it shows. Theirs is the most diverse and populous of the factions, home to animals, plant-beings, and fey spirits alike.

      alloyin:
        desc: Alloyin is a technology focused faction. Based on durable creatures with armor to crush opponents.
        official_0: "The Alloyin seek one thing above all else: knowledge."
        official_1: A fanatical devotion to advancement has led them to vastly outstrip the other factions in technology.
        official_2: The one true city upon Solis, the Alloyin capital of Brightsteel lies just to the north of the SolForge, its gleaming towers standing in stark relief to the frozen wasteland around them. The constant whirring of machines can be heard for miles around even over the howling of the winds.

      tempys:
        desc: Tempys are elemental based. They generally are mobile and hit quickly giving you flexibility no matter what lane you fight in.
        official_0: While the other factions retreat from the harsh environments across Solis, the Tempys embrace them.
        official_1: These nomads live exposed to the elements, for it is from the elements that they draw their strength. Masters of flame and frost, stone and storm alike, the Tempys harness the elements to do their bidding.
        official_2: As wild as the winds themselves, the clans roam the tundra seeking to prove their might, clashing with one another as well as with those foes that may cross their path.

      nekrium:
        desc: Nekrium is the death faction. Using death to achieve their goals, sacrificing cards to gain an advantage or killing enemies to snowball units.
        official_0: Few can survive for very long on the frozen wastes the Nekrium call home. They pay the harsh climate little concern, however, as most of them have been dead for years.
        official_1: The Nekrium are masters of death magic. While some living human practitioners remain among their ranks, the bulk of their number are mindless zombies and skeletons, the reanimated corpses of outsiders who died within their borders in some foolish quest for immortality.
        official_2: Only those whose lives are extinguished in necromantic rituals return as the higher forms of undeath that sit upon the ruling council of the Nekrium.

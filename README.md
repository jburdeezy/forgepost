Random side project for the Solforge game.

Note, that I do not provide any support or help with running this. The fonts used for tooltips (Optimus Princeceps and Otpimus Princeps Semi Bold) are not distributed in this and need to be acquired separately. Stoneblade assets (card images, icons, and so on) are not included and need to be manually extracted.

Data is extracted from the iOS client by using the old extracted packages. If you want to load the entire DB you would need at least the latest iOS package in the data/ folder. See script/resync_data.rb and script/resync_images.rb
